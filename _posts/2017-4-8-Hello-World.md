title: My first blog post using GitHub and Jekyll!
---

First blog post made with Jekyll! Woot and such! In this first post,
I'll share some notes on what I learned today at the first class meeting of the very first [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- How to setup GitBash, fork and clone a repo on GitHub
- How to git add, commit and push code to a GitHub repo

## Questions:

-
-

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- using the constructor for objects buggy in Data Structures lesson in Codecademy
- might need to use literal object notation instead to finish lesson properly

## Useful links to save for later:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY (How to Learn Anything)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TXEZ4tP06c (Why People believe they can't draw)

## My next goals:

- Catch up with my UnBootcamp meetup
- Finish the Codecademy tutorial
- Reduce distraction barriers
- Learn to self correct with debugger and online resources (Googling)
