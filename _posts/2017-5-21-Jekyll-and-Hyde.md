title: Fleshing out a Dungeon Crawler!
---

After figuring out how to get an old school [dikuMUD](https://github.com/techguy95/CrimsonSkies) up and running on a Google Cloud Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Z), I celebrated with a handle of Dewar's dreaming of a warm fuzzy buzz -
but instead I overindulged and ironically became Mr. Hyde while writing a Jekyll blog post!
The Last Chapter of the [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- I need to limit my elixir consumption from unlimited to 2-4 vials per day
- Disconnect from the internet when drinking more than 6 vials of elixir

## Questions:

- How do I move on from this catastrophe?
- Should I stick with the online tutorials and the Eloquent Javascript book?
- How can I vanquish my desire to be utterly hammered?

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- I discovered a bug in my own self - stemming from the stark reality of the duality of man
- Man has a good and bad side to his personality, I wanted to indulge fully in the bad side after many shots of elixir and realize all my hidden desires.
- Playin with fire, or in this case a handle of Dewar's - you're gonna get burnt, black-out and have a rude awakening.


## Useful links to save for later:

## My next goals:

- Try to figure out what to do regarding continuing to learn JavaScript
- Apologize to everyone in the UnBootcamp crew and Learn Teach Code slack chatroom
- Start a martial arts program ASAP
