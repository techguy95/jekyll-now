title: Fight with the Balrog!
---
As a novice JavaScript mage in life and coding, I turned my back for a brief moment and found myself falling into an epic battle with my own personal Balrog.  A Balrog was a demon of the ancient world - and metaphorically speaking, my coding journey finally brought me back into conflict with Mr. Hyde - a legendary Balrog hiding deep within the darkest regions of my soul.  Let's continue our coding journey with a [Choose Your Own Adventure game] that our Learn Teach Code unBootcamp created in our first mini-hackathon party.
