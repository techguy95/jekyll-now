Day three of the mystical journey of javascript...
Updates on the [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- cloning a project from heroku to local
- use the heroku cli and link it to my repo on GitHub
- use https://repl.it to run code quickly
- how to calculate unique pairs with a js function
{% highlight javascript %}
function result(num)
{
  var combos = (num * (num - 1))/2;
  console.log("There would be " + combos + " number of UNIQUE pairings!");
}
var students = prompt ("So how many students are in the unBootcamp?");
result(students);
{% endhighlight %}


## Questions:

- how does cloud9 work?  (need to play around with it)
-

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

-
-

## Useful links to save for later:

- https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
- https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/openipov1/deploy/heroku-git

## My next goals:

- make sure to attend 2nd class of the UnBootcamp
- Finish the Codecademy tutorial
- Meditate 5 minutes daily and become more Zen
- Be more efficient with batch cooking (part of time management)
