---

This is my second blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this first post, I'll share some notes on what I learned today at the first class meeting of the very first [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- literal notation for objects
- using codecademy forums when stuck on a problem

## Questions:

- figuring out how to post the 2nd post on the blog
-

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- stuck on 2nd post appearing
-

## Useful links to save for later:

- https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/javascript
-

## My next goals:

- Use Heroku to deploy a project
- Finish the Codecademy tutorial
- Set aside 20 minutes for scheduling and time management
- Work faster with codecademy forum and google
