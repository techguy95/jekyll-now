title: Forging the code!
---

On a cold, dark and misty morning I joined the UnBootcamp crew for our mini-Hackathon.  We decided to collaborate and create the start of a "Choose your own Adventure" game!
Updates on the [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- How to quickly scrum and brainstorm in a collaborative manner to forge a project through "Mob Coding"
- How to wireframe a project by sketching out on paper

## Questions:

-
-

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- The GitHub project I cloned earlier did not compile correctly because of an antiquated library dependency from an ancient UNIX/VAX C code base
- I discovered that the C program used an sqlite package to store user sessions for their equipment, stats, inventory, experience/level, player description and more


## Useful links to save for later:

-


## My next goals:

- Find a modern linux distro version of dikuMUD code that will compile on a Google cloud Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) instance.
- Once the code runs, examine the structure and guts of the code to help me envision, architect and code a new version of a this dungeon crawler in node.js
