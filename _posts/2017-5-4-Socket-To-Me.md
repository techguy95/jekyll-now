title: May the Force be with you!

The Force works in mysterious ways...and so does JavaScript!
Let's take a look at how we setup a realtime chatroom webapp
using Express, Node.js WebSocket and Socket.io!
Updates on the [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- As a warmup, we started to build a very simple calculator app. You can see our code in this CodePen here\: http://codepen.io/LearnTeachCode/pen/xddbxx
- We learned about SocketIO and WebSocket for real-time communication between server and clients, and we made a basic chatroom app!
- All the working code for the chatroom app is here: https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/socketio-chat-demo/
- Also I had my first experience debugging code by sprinkling console.log statements on a piece of code that I forgot how worked
