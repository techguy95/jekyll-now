Check out how we learned how to throw up a simple website using javascript to run a MadLibs game!
Another exciting chapter in the blogosphere of the [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment!

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- How to call javascript files and libraries in the HTML document
  Point to an external javascript file:
{% highlight javascript %}
<script src="myscripts.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
I uploaded the MadLibs site to my GitHub account here: https://techguy95.github.io/madlibs
- How to git add, commit and push code to a GitHub repo

## Questions:

-
-

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- using the constructor for objects buggy in Data Structures lesson in Codecademy
- might need to use literal object notation instead to finish lesson properly

## Useful links to save for later:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY (How to Learn Anything)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TXEZ4tP06c (Why People believe they can't draw)

## My next goals:

- Catch up with my UnBootcamp meetup
- Finish the Codecademy tutorial
- Reduce distraction barriers
- Learn to self correct with debugger and online resources (Googling)
