Check out how we learned how to throw up a simple website using javascript to run a MadLibs game!
Another exciting chapter in the blogosphere of the [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment!

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- How to call javascript files and libraries in the HTML document
  Point to an external javascript file:
{% highlight javascript %}
<script src="myscripts.js"></script>
<!-- bring in the socket.io library in the next line -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="socket.io.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

- I uploaded the MadLibs site to my GitHub account here: https://techguy95.github.io/madlibs
- The code was on my laptop so I made a new GitHub repo for this lesson using this guide https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/
- When I started working on the desktop "rig" I pulled the code down that I uploaded to the GitHub repo from my laptop using this guide https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/#pull
- I almost forgot to mention something wonderful I learned in the class was about event based loop

## Questions:

- How can I permanently store user or session data from a signup form on a website using javascript (node.js? hmm)?
- Curious about FireBase...  I keep hearing about FireBase and i'm fired up!  Let me read up more about it here https://firebase.google.com

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- the missing link: calling javascript & libraries through html (#TIL)
- trying to comprehend and visualize when you would need to use literal or constructor notation for objects

## My next goals:

- Developing the habit of consistently coding and blogging daily
- Finish the Codecademy tutorial
- Tactfully manage distraction barriers
- Take advantage of opportunities for meditation and brainstorming
